# MyCareHCL

Health Care Patient Portal

TechStacks:-
Front-End:- REACT 18, MUI, TypeScript(Optional), Redux-Toolkit, React Testing library
Back-End :- Node, Express, MongoDb

-Created collection for Users and Appointments
-Developed enpoints for Login, Register and Logout
-Developed enpoints for Appointment creations,and to get list of all the appointments

SECURITY IMPROVEMENTS

- Input validation and sanitization using express-validator, Joi, or Zod
- Use helmet to secure HTTP headers
- CSRF protection with csurf and proper CORS configuration
- Use JWT for authentication: access token in headers, refresh token in httpOnly cookie
- Role-based access control for protected routes
- Rate limiting with express-rate-limit to prevent abuse
- Enable WAF (Web Application Firewall) via API Gateway or reverse proxy
- Secure secrets using environment variables or AWS Secrets Manager

PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATION

- Use Redis for caching database responses, sessions, and rate limiting
- Enable GZIP compression using compression middleware
- Use async and non-blocking operations to handle I/O
- Implement connection pooling for databases (e.g., mongoose or pg-pool)
- Profile and fix memory leaks using Node.js inspector or tools like clinic.js
- Lazy load large modules or features only when needed

CODE ARCHITECTURE

- Separate routes, controllers, services, and data access layers
- Use DTOs and consistent typings (with TypeScript if possible)
- Centralized error handler for all Express errors
- Modular or feature-based folder structure
- Implement unit, integration, and end-to-end tests using Jest and Supertest
- Avoid circular dependencies and keep functions small and testable
- Use custom error classes for clean exception handling

SCALABILITY

- Containerize services using Docker
- Use ECS or Kubernetes to deploy and auto-scale services
- Ensure APIs are stateless (donâ€™t store session data in memory)
- Use queues (e.g., RabbitMQ, Kafka) for event-driven architecture
- Decompose large codebase into microservices or a modular monolith
- Implement horizontal scaling with load balancers and API gateways

CI/CD AND DEPLOYMENT

- Set up GitHub Actions or GitLab CI for build, test, and deploy pipelines
- Use multi-stage Docker builds to reduce image size
- Automate deployments to ECS or Kubernetes clusters
- Separate environment variables for dev, staging, and production
- Add pre-commit hooks using husky and lint-staged
- Use semantic versioning and commit message conventions

LOGGING AND MONITORING

- Enable CloudWatch for AWS services logging
- Set up Prometheus and Grafana for performance monitoring
- Use Sentry or Bugsnag for error tracking in frontend and backend
- Add alerting for CPU, memory, downtime, and high error rates
- Enable distributed tracing with OpenTelemetry or AWS X-Ray

FRONTEND INTEGRATION (React + MUI)

- Use MUI themes and custom breakpoints for consistent styling
- Implement protected routes using route guards or auth wrappers
- Handle token refresh in Axios interceptors
- Use responsive design patterns with Grid, Box, and useMediaQuery
- Implement lazy loading of routes with React.lazy and Suspense
- Write tests for critical UI flows using React Testing Library
